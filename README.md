# ultra_cnn
A set of Python scripts for using Keras and TensorFlow to develop and assess "face recognition" methods based on convolutional neural networks for identifying individual tree logs, as described in the publication E. Holmstr√∂m, A. Raatevaara, J. Pohjankukka, H. Korpunen, and J. Uusitalo (in preparation). In addition, code for the classical LBP approach presented in the paper available here.

The dataset used in the publication can be found on Zenodo:
